### [openresty](http://openresty.org/en/) docker image

#### Description

Dockerfile + APKBUILD files to build a docker container with openresty.
Dockerfile uses multi-stage building, so you need to have docker >= 17.05.
Openresty is built from sources (see ./apk directory).
The resulting image will also include the following luarocks modules:

* web (wrapper over lua-resty-http)
* lua-resty-exec
* docker
* pgmoon
* lsqlite3
* inspect

#### Usage

Nginx is configured to include every `*.conf` file from `/etc/nginx/conf.d/`
(files from this dir included **above** nginx http config block) and 
`/etc/nginx/vhosts/` directories, so you can just mount a host directory 
with your virtual hosts configs to container's `/etc/nginx/vhosts` directory.
